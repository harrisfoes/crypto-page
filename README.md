- Mobile-first workflow

- [Tailwind CSS] - For styles

### What I learned

This is a step up from my previous project which was a landing page with no scrolling. The challenges here were to juggle the multiple parts together and make them synchronize so they look presentable nomatter what the device size is.

### Continued development

The crypto form functionality could be added once I have time and the sufficient knowledge to do so.

### Useful resources

Tailwind Cheatshets
